                                    yay first diary entry! as i write this the website isnt actually published yet... i still have to figure out how im going to do that. but i wanted to make a diary entry anyway! (mostly just to test out how im going to do this). im still trying to figure out a bunch of different things for this website and i dont think it will ever be truly finished. but ive made a lot of progress so far! so i thought i would make an entry talking about the beginning of my journey trying to make this website.

                                     i could not tell you why i decided that taking on a project in the middle of the school year, at the end of the semester, was a good idea. but i did. and now im here! i actually decided to do this because i watched a youtube video of someone looking at personal websites and i thought to myself 'hey, i want to do that'. was this a mistake? who knows. it is defnitely however an undertaking i do not have the time for... but i have made time! somehow.

                                    when i started this website (last week) i had absolutely 0 coding experience. actual coding experience. the little "coding" i did was on scratch in elemantary school and a camp i went to when i was a kid where we built robots and made code for them. but that was all years ago. and none of it was actually that useful... especially because i have basically no memory of any of it. so i started learning how to code for this website with 0 background knowledge and absolutely no idea what i was doing. and i still dont know what im doing. but hey! this website seems to work, mostly, so it looks like im doing pretty well! i started learning how to code through youtube tuts and then i was introduced to w3 schools which is where i actually learned how to do this. except the problem is i still dont really know how to code. so if your wondering 'how did she learn how to code in 1 week??', well i didnt. i spent one week learning the absolute basics and then i pretty much just looked up how to do everything else. which really taught me nothing.

                                    <p class="index-text">
                                    after learning how to code i pulled pretty much everything else out of my butt. by looking things up. and through much trial and error we have arrived here! and while there is still so much i want to do and so much room for improvement. i realize that this is a project that is gonna take a long time. it will take me a long time to actually learn how to code and i need to be patient with myself. which is maybe harder than actually learning how to code. i am not a patient person and whenever im learning something i have a extremely hard time reminding myself that learning things take time. and i always end getting frustrated with myself when im not magically capable of doing something perfectly as soon as i learn it. so similar to every other time i try something new im going to have to do my best to not get to frustrated and give up.

                                    at this point in my website journey the next big step is publishing the website... it took me a while to figure out how i want to publish this website. at first i was thinking of using neocities but ive decided that neocities is to similar to a social media platform and thats not what im looking for. after doing some research (watching a youtube video) i landed on using a platform called vercel. i ran into 2 problems though. the first is that vercel updates directly from github and i have been using firebase to do all my coding, this is a relatively easy thing to fix tho so its not much of a actualy problem its mostly just annoying, the second problem is that if you want to publish on vercel you have to sign into your github acc (easy right?) and then you need to use your phone to get a confirmation code. this is where i have a problem. at the moment my phone is broken and cannot get texts from andriods or confirmation codes... this is a problem that could very easily be fixed if i just went to a apple store. except i cant go by myself because i cant drive. so i have been asking my mom for a total of 2 months to go get my phone fixed. but until that happens i will not be able to use vercel. so rigt now my new plan is to publish through firebase and then once i get my phone fixed to publish through vercel. or if i find out that i hate publishing through firebase ill enlist the help of someone else and use their phone to get a confirmation code.
